        <hr />

        Personality disorders (PD) are a class of mental disorders characterized
        by enduring maladaptive patterns of behavior, cognition, and inner
        experience, exhibited across many contexts and deviating from those
        accepted by the individual's culture. These patterns develop early, are
        inflexible, and are associated with significant distress or disability.
        The definitions may vary somewhat, according to source, and remain a
        matter of controversy. Official criteria for diagnosing personality
        disorders are listed in the fifth chapter of the International
        Classification of Diseases (ICD) and in the American Psychiatric
        Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
        (DSM).

          Both diagnostic systems provide a definition and six criteria for a
          general personality disorder. These criteria should be met by all
          personality disorder cases before a more specific diagnosis can be
          made. The
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICD-10" target="_blank">ICD-10</a>
          lists these general guideline criteria:

        </header>
        <hr />

        The specific personality disorders are grouped into the following three
        clusters based on descriptive similarities:
        <h2>Cluster A (odd or eccentric disorders)</h2>
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" id="showbtnA">
          show more..
        </button>

        <ul id="A" class="A">
          Cluster A personality disorders are often associated with
          schizophrenia: in particular, schizotypal personality disorder shares
          some of its hallmark symptoms with schizophrenia, e.g., acute
          discomfort in close relationships, cognitive or perceptual
          distortions, and eccentricities of behavior. However, people diagnosed
          with odd-eccentric personality disorders tend to have a greater grasp
          on reality than those with schizophrenia. Patients suffering from
          these disorders can be paranoid and have difficulty being understood
          by others, as they often have odd or eccentric modes of speaking and
          an unwillingness and inability to form and maintain close
          relationships. Though their perceptions may be unusual, these
          anomalies are distinguished from delusions or hallucinations as people
          suffering from these would be diagnosed with other conditions.
          Significant evidence suggests a small proportion of people with
          Cluster A personality disorders, especially schizotypal personality
          disorder, have the potential to develop schizophrenia and other
          psychotic disorders. These disorders also have a higher probability of
          occurring among individuals whose first-degree relatives have either
          schizophrenia or a Cluster A personality disorder.

            <a href="index2.html" target="_blank">Paranoid personality disorder:</a>characterized

        <h1>What is Paranoid personality disorder?</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Paranoid personality disorder (PPD) is a mental illness characterized
          by paranoid delusions, and a pervasive, long-standing suspiciousness
          and generalized mistrust of others. People with this personality
          disorder may be hypersensitive, easily insulted, and habitually relate
          to the world by vigilant scanning of the environment for clues or
          suggestions that may validate their fears or biases. They are eager
          observers. They think they are in danger and look for signs and
          threats of that danger, potentially not appreciating other
          interpretations or evidence. They tend to be guarded and suspicious
          and have quite constricted emotional lives. Their reduced capacity for
          meaningful emotional involvement and the general pattern of isolated
          withdrawal often lend a quality of schizoid isolation to their life
          experience. People with PPD may have a tendency to bear grudges,
          suspiciousness, tendency to interpret others' actions as hostile,
          persistent tendency to self-reference, or a tenacious sense of
          personal right. Patients with this disorder can also have significant
          comorbidity with other personality disorders (such as schizotypal,
          schizoid, narcissistic, avoidant and borderline).
